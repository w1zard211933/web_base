# How to host Flashblocks-aware RPC nodes

## Quick Start

1. **Prerequisites**:

   - Docker and Docker Compose
   - Minimum hardware requirements (see [node README](https://github.com/base/node?tab=readme-ov-file#hardware-requirements))
   - Access to a Flashblocks websocket endpoint, we provide public endpoints in the env files in the repo

2. **Set Up Environment**:

   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/base/node.git
   cd node
   ```

3. **Start the Node with Flashblocks Support**:
   ```bash
   NODE_TYPE=base CLIENT=reth docker-compose up
   ```

## Configuration Options

- **Node Type**: Use `NODE_TYPE=base` to enable base reth node withFlashblocks functionality
- **Network**: Use `NETWORK_ENV=.env.mainnet` for mainnet or `NETWORK_ENV=.env.sepolia` for testnet

## Verifying Flashblocks Functionality

Test that your node is properly supporting Flashblocks by querying a pending block:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getBlockByNumber","params":["pending", false],"id":1}' \
  http://localhost:8545
```

## Available RPC Methods

Flashblocks-aware nodes provide all standard Ethereum JSON-RPC methods plus specialized Flashblocks endpoints. For more details, see the [Flashblocks RPC API documentation](https://docs.base.org/chain/flashblocks/apps#rpc-api).

## Further Resources

For detailed information about node setup, including hardware requirements and additional configuration options, refer to the [Reth node README](https://github.com/base/op-geth/blob/main/node/reth/README.md).
