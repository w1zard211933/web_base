# Snapshots

Using a snapshot significantly reduces the initial time required to sync a Base node. Snapshots are updated regularly.

:::warning

Geth Archive Nodes are no longer supported via snapshots due to performance limitations. For Archive functionality, please use Reth.

:::

If you're a prospective or current Base node operator, you can restore from a snapshot to speed up your initial sync. Follow the steps below carefully.

### Restoring from Snapshot

These steps assume you are in the cloned `node` directory (the one containing `docker-compose.yml`).

1.  **Prepare Data Directory**:

    - **Before running Docker for the first time**, create the data directory on your host machine that will be mapped into the Docker container. This directory must match the `volumes` mapping in the `docker-compose.yml` file for the client you intend to use.
      - For Geth: `mkdir ./geth-data`
      - For Reth: `mkdir ./reth-data`
    - If you have previously run the node and have an existing data directory, **stop the node** (`docker compose down`), remove the _contents_ of the existing directory (e.g., `rm -rf ./geth-data/*`), and proceed.

2.  **Download Snapshot**: Choose the appropriate snapshot for your network and client from the table below. Use `wget` or a similar tool to download it into the `node` directory.

    | Network | Client | Snapshot Type | Download Command (`wget ...`)                                                                                    |
    | ------- | ------ | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Testnet | Geth   | Full          | `https://sepolia-full-snapshots.base.org/$(curl https://sepolia-full-snapshots.base.org/latest)`                 |
    | Testnet | Reth   | Archive       | `https://sepolia-reth-archive-snapshots.base.org/$(curl https://sepolia-reth-archive-snapshots.base.org/latest)` |
    | Mainnet | Geth   | Full          | `https://mainnet-full-snapshots.base.org/$(curl https://mainnet-full-snapshots.base.org/latest)`                 |
    | Mainnet | Reth   | Archive       | `https://mainnet-reth-archive-snapshots.base.org/$(curl https://mainnet-reth-archive-snapshots.base.org/latest)` |

    :::info

    Ensure you have enough free disk space to download the snapshot archive (`.tar.gz` file) _and_ extract its contents. The extracted data will be significantly larger than the archive.

    :::

3.  **Extract Snapshot**: Untar the downloaded snapshot archive. Replace `<snapshot-filename.tar.gz>` with the actual downloaded filename.

    ```bash
    tar -xzvf <snapshot-filename.tar.gz>
    ```

4.  **Move Data**: The extraction process will likely create a directory (e.g., `geth` or similar, check the output of the `tar` command).

    - Move the _contents_ of this extracted directory into the data directory you created in Step 1.
      - Example (if archive extracted to a `geth` folder):
        ```bash
        # For Geth
        mv ./geth/* ./geth-data/
        rm -rf ./geth # Clean up empty extracted folder
        ```
      - Example (if archive extracted to a `reth` folder - **verify actual folder name**):
        ```bash
        # For Reth
        mv ./reth/* ./reth-data/
        rm -rf ./reth # Clean up empty extracted folder
        ```
    - The goal is to have the chain data (directories like `chaindata`, `nodes`, `segments`, etc.) directly inside `./geth-data` or `./reth-data`, not within an extra subfolder.

5.  **Start the Node**: Now that the snapshot data is in place, start the node using the appropriate command (see the [Running a Base Node](/chain/run-a-base-node#setting-up-and-running-the-node) guide):

    ```bash
    # Example for Mainnet Geth
    docker compose up --build -d
    ```

6.  **Verify and Clean Up**: Monitor the node logs (`docker compose logs -f <service_name>`) or use the [sync monitoring](/chain/run-a-base-node#monitoring-sync-progress) command to ensure the node starts syncing from the snapshot's block height. Once confirmed, you can safely delete the downloaded snapshot archive (`.tar.gz` file) to free up disk space.
